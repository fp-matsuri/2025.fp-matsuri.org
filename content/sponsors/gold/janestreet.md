**Work functionally**

It’s no secret that we’re big believers in functional programming and use OCaml. Jane Street’s technology group is small by design, which means we need to maximize the productivity of each person we hire. But it’s not about productivity alone: programming in a rich and expressive language like OCaml is just more fun.

At Jane Street, functional programming isn’t a tool we reserve for some special set of problems. From systems automation to trading systems, from monitoring tools to research code, we write everything that we can in OCaml.
